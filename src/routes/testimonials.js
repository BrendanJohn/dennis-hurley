                <p>"I directed Dennis Hurley in the world premiere production of the play DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH  at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in which he played the leading man.  Dennis was juggling several projects at the time, dividing his time between DC and New York.  He did the part with humor and sensitivity.  
                  It was a pleasure working with him and I would be happy to hire him again in the future."</p>

                <p>"I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Hurley in a production of Shakespeare's' "Titus Andronicus". 
                  I was consistently impressed with his unflagging energy and commitment to the process. 
                  His focus is laser-sharp and his desire to explore and develop within his role was very strong. 
                  His albinism may be a defining physical trait to other's but Dennis' nature and artistic curiosity dissolved any perceived imitations. 
                  In action sequences, at first there were some issues with coordination and vision but Dennis' natural 
                  discipline and investment overcame these road bumps and his performances were always exciting and consistent. 
                  Indeed his condition served more as a catalyst for a deeper, more nuanced character rather than a distraction."</p>

                  Dennis is just as adept at handling drama and weighty moments, though, and is thoroughly skilled at handling Shakespearean verse.  
                  He is a complete actor, and has a distinct quirkiness about him that has made him one of my primary go-to-guys whenever I'm casting a show.."</p>
